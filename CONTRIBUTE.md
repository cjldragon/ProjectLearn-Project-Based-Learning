# Contributing to ProjectLearn

As this project is community-driven, feel free to open an issue (or even better, send a Pull Request) for expanding this list. Contributions are very much welcome.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure the project tutorial to be added doesn't already exist and it is of good quality (code quality, project scope & project relevance).
2. Update the [data.js](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning/blob/master/src/data.js) file. Links must be pointing straight to the tutorials, no URL shorteners.
3. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning/blob/master/README.md) with details of the new project tutorial, according to the associated programming language.
